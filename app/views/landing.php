							<h3>High quality software development will cost you a fortune.</h3>
							<p>
								If you know the tricks of the trade it doesn’t have to.  With clever 
								prioritization and the correct choice of technology stack, it is possible 
								to get great results while curbing costs. Having bootstrapped our own startups
								we are experts at this.
							</p>  
							<p> 
								Another skill that we've learned from our bootstrapping days is identifying, 
								developing and managing great developers. Putting all of this
								together allows us to produce top quality work at affordable prices.

							<h3>You need to have a technical background.</h3>
							<p>
								You need a great vision to get things started and that does not 
								require a technical background.  However, a technical background 
								comes in real handy when putting together a plan and executing that plan.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is where our years of project-management expertise comes in. 
								Our project managers are well-versed in both “business” and “geek” speak.  
								They can effectively communicate your vision to the technical team, while explaining 
								technical concepts to you in plain English.
